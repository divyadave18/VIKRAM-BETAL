        Once upon a time there lived a king of Ujjayani by name of Dharmadhvaja,
        who had three exquisitely sensitive queens. He loved all three of them very
        much, all of them were of unparalleled beauty.
        On one occasion, while the king was playing with the first queen, he ruffled
        her hair. The lotus flower on her ear fell over her thigh, and made a wound
        and she cried out loud. The king was surprised at her sensitivity and
        immediately requested medical attention for her.
        On another occasion, when he was with the second queen on a full moon night
        on the roof of his palace, the queen suddenly felt her skin burning of the
        moonlight. The king ordered medical attention for her too and was again
        surprised at her sensitivity.
        On third occasion, when he was with the third queen, she collpased on the
        floor on hearing of the sound of a mortar grinding rice, far far away. The king
        immediately ordered medical attention for her and was surprised too.
        Since then he took utmost care of his three ultra sensitive queens.
        Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three
        queens is the most sensitive? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The
        third one, as she had not even been touched by the light or flower. She had
        only heard a noise from distance."
        As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back to the
        tree.  <br>
