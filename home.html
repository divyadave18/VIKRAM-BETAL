                Vikram Aur Betaal is based on 'Betaal Pachisi', written in the 11th century by Kashmiri poet Somdev Bhatt.
            These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the witty ghost Betaal.
            Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. He had immense
            love for learning as well as for adventure. He was brave, fearless, and with a strong will. Every day many
            visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to accept all the gifts with the same
            courtesy. Among such visitors was a mendicant who presented the king with fruit on every visit. King
            Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day while handling the fruit, it
            broke and from the top came out a handy ball of a ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the
            fruits, and from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the mendicant. However, the
            mendicant had set a condition that the King must meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation
            ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King met him as decided.
            The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this. The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a
            King like Vikramaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northernmost corner of this ground
            where he would find a very ancient tree. There would be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would
            have to fetch it for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers which he would get
            only if a king brought this particular corpse to him and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it.
